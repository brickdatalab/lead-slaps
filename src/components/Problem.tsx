          The 'Race to the Bottom': Why Your Current MCA Leads Don't Convert

          The problem isn't your sales team; it's your vendor's business model. Traditional providers sell the same lead to 10-20 brokers, creating prospect burnout and making conversion nearly impossible. This forces good brokers to compete on price, not value, destroying margins and morale.
