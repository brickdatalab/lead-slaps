This means you are the only broker receiving that specific lead at that time, giving you an uncontested opportunity to connect with the merchant and close the deal without competition from other brokers."

Shared real-time leads cost $15-$30 per lead. Aged MCA leads are the most affordable at $5-$15 per lead. Contact us for current pricing and volume discounts."

They have higher intent and convert faster but cost more. Aged MCA leads are older inquiries (30-180 days old) from businesses that previously expressed interest in funding. They cost significantly less and can be highly effective for teams with consistent multi-touch follow-up campaigns."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "An MCA live transfer is a pre-qualified, interested merchant who is transferred directly to your sales team in a live phone call. Our team handles the initial contact and qualification. When the merchant expresses interest and meets your criteria, we connect them to your closer instantly via a warm transfer, allowing your team to focus on closing instead of cold calling. We bridge the gap between a cold lead and a set appointment."

We verify consent at the source, scrub every lead against national DNC lists and known litigator databases before delivery, and provide full audit trails including timestamps, IP addresses, and opt-in copy for your records."

The best leads also include enriched data like bank statement verification, credit score ranges, and industry type. Lead Slaps provides AI scoring to help you prioritize the most fundable prospects. Unlike UCC lists (public records), our leads are 100% inbound generated."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, for most teams. Exclusive MCA leads cost 2-3x more than shared leads, but they convert at 3-5x higher rates because you're not competing with 10-20 other brokers. The merchant hasn't been burned out by multiple calls, and you have a clean shot at building rapport and closing the deal. The higher conversion rate typically results in better ROI despite the higher upfront cost."

Lead Slaps offers customizable lead filters including minimum monthly revenue, time in business, credit score ranges, industry type, geographic location, and funding amount requested. You can configure your filters to ensure you only receive leads that match your underwriting criteria, reducing wasted time on unqualified prospects."
