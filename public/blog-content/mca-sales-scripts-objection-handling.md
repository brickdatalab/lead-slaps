# MCA Sales Scripts That Close: Objection Handling for Brokers

**Primary Keyword:** MCA sales scripts

Converting merchant cash advance (MCA) leads into funded deals requires more than just calling prospects—it demands precise communication strategies that address concerns, build trust, and create urgency. The difference between a 5% close rate and a 25% close rate often comes down to having battle-tested MCA sales scripts that handle objections before they derail your deal.

In the competitive merchant cash advance sales landscape, brokers who master objection handling consistently outperform those who wing it. This comprehensive guide delivers word-for-word scripts, proven rebuttals, and closing techniques specifically designed for MCA broker scripts that convert conversations into commissions.

## The Opening: First 30 Seconds That Set Up the Close

Your opening determines whether the conversation continues or ends abruptly. Here are three proven MCA sales scripts for different lead types:

### Script 1: For Live Transfer Leads

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. You just spoke with my colleague about accessing capital for your business. I have your application pulled up here—looks like you're looking for around [$X] to [stated purpose]. Is that still accurate?"

This script works because it acknowledges the warm introduction, demonstrates you're prepared, and immediately confirms their need. When working with [live transfer leads](/products), this transition from the qualifier to the closer should feel seamless.

### Script 2: For Pre-Qualified Data Leads

"[Name], this is [Your Name] calling from [Company]. We specialize in fast funding for [industry] businesses in [location], and based on your business profile, you may qualify for up to [$X] in working capital with approval in as little as 24 hours. Do you have two minutes to see if this makes sense for you?"

This approach establishes credibility through specificity and creates curiosity with the funding amount. When using [pre-qualified MCA leads](/build-data-set), reference specific data points you have about their business to build immediate trust.

### Script 3: For Aged Leads (Reactivation)

"Hi [Name], [Your Name] here with [Company]. I'm calling because you inquired about business funding back in [timeframe], and I wanted to reach out personally because we've recently expanded our programs. A lot has changed—are you still looking to grow your business, or did you already get the capital you needed?"

This script acknowledges the time gap, provides a reason for calling now, and uses a binary question that either qualifies them or disqualifies them quickly.

## The Qualifying Questions Framework

Once you have their attention, use this question sequence to uncover urgency and fit:

**Script Framework:**

1. "What prompted you to look into funding right now?" (Uncovers urgency)
2. "If you had access to capital today, what would be your first priority?" (Identifies use case)
3. "How quickly do you need the funds in your account?" (Establishes timeline)
4. "What's your average monthly revenue?" (Qualifies deal size)
5. "Have you explored business funding options before?" (Identifies sophistication level)

These questions position you as a consultant rather than a salesperson, and the answers provide the ammunition you need to overcome objections later in the call.

## Top 5 Objections with Word-for-Word Rebuttals

Mastering MCA objection handling separates top producers from struggling brokers. Here are the five most common objections with proven responses:

### Objection 1: "I'm Not Interested"

**Your Response:**
"I completely understand, [Name]. Most of our best clients weren't interested when I first called either—until they realized how quickly they could access capital without affecting their credit or putting up collateral. Can I ask what you're using for business financing right now when opportunities come up?"

**Why It Works:** Acknowledges their objection, uses social proof, and pivots to a curiosity-building question. Many [live transfer leads](/products) use this as a knee-jerk response, not a real objection.

### Objection 2: "The Rate Is Too High"

**Your Response:**
"That's a fair concern, and I appreciate you being direct. Here's what I tell all my clients: the rate is only too high if the return doesn't make sense. If you invest [$X] into [their stated purpose] and it generates [2-3x return example], then the cost of capital is just a business expense. More importantly, the question isn't whether the rate is high—it's whether NOT having access to capital right now is costing you more. What opportunities are you missing while you're waiting for cheaper money?"

**Why It Works:** Reframes cost as an investment, introduces opportunity cost, and shifts focus from price to value. This is critical when closing MCA deals where rates are inherently higher than traditional financing.

### Objection 3: "I Need to Think About It"

**Your Response:**
"Absolutely, [Name], this is a business decision and you should think it through. Let me ask you this—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the payment structure, the amount, or something else? Because if I can address that now, it might save you time."

*[Pause for their response]*

"Got it. Here's the thing: I've been doing this for [X] years, and in my experience, when business owners say they need to think about it, one of two things is happening—either there's a concern we haven't addressed yet, or the timing just isn't right. Which one is it for you?"

**Why It Works:** Forces the real objection to surface. "Think about it" is rarely the actual issue—it's usually code for an unspoken concern or lack of urgency.

### Objection 4: "I Already Have Funding"

**Your Response:**
"That's great to hear, [Name]—it sounds like you're already growth-focused. Out of curiosity, what kind of funding are you currently using? And more importantly, what's your approval limit if you needed additional capital next month?"

*[Listen to their answer]*

"Perfect. Here's why I'm asking: most successful business owners have multiple capital sources because one lender can't always accommodate every opportunity. We work with businesses specifically as a secondary or emergency funding source. If you ever max out your current line or need capital faster than they can deliver, it makes sense to have us as a backup. Can I get your information on file so you have options if you ever need them?"

**Why It Works:** Positions your offering as complementary rather than competitive, and creates a "backup plan" that feels low-pressure but keeps you in the game.

### Objection 5: "Just Send Me the Information"

**Your Response:**
"I'd be happy to send information, [Name], but honestly, generic information won't help you because every business is different. What I'd rather do is ask you three quick questions so I can send you something specific to your situation—along with actual numbers for your business. That way you're not wasting time reading about programs you don't even qualify for. Fair enough?"

*[Proceed to qualifying questions]*

**Alternative Close:**
"Here's the challenge with sending information: I've been doing this long enough to know that email usually gets buried, and then we're playing phone tag for a week. Instead, let's do this—I'll pull up exactly what you qualify for right now while I have you on the phone. It takes 90 seconds, and if it doesn't make sense, you can tell me no and I'll leave you alone. If it does make sense, we can move forward today. Either way, you get an answer instead of waiting. Sound fair?"

**Why It Works:** Addresses the real issue (avoidance) and reframes your pitch as efficiency rather than pressure. Many prospects use "send information" as a polite brush-off; this script calls it out respectfully.

## The Close: Creating Urgency and Next Steps

Once you've handled objections, you need a closing script that creates urgency without feeling pushy:

**Standard Close:**
"[Name], based on everything you've shared, it sounds like [restate their need/goal]. The good news is you qualify for [amount] with funding as soon as [timeframe]. To move forward, I just need to send over a simple one-page application—I can email or text it to you right now. Which is better for you?"

**Urgency Close (For Time-Sensitive Leads):**
"Here's what I recommend: we have [number] applications ahead of you right now, and our underwriting team processes these first-come, first-served. If you want to get funded this week, we need to submit your application today. I can walk you through it right now in about 5 minutes, or I can send it over and follow up in an hour. What works better?"

**Soft Close (For Hesitant Prospects):**
"[Name], let me be direct with you—I don't want to pressure you into anything. But I also don't want you to miss out on an opportunity because you waited. Here's what I suggest: let's get your application submitted today. There's no obligation, and you can always say no when you see the final offer. At least then you'll know exactly what's available instead of wondering. Does that make sense?"

## Leveraging Technology and Data for Better Conversions

Modern MCA sales isn't just about scripts—it's about having the right leads to call. Brokers who consistently close use data intelligence to prioritize their pipeline:

- **Lead Scoring**: Use [FundSense AI scoring](/add-ons) to identify which prospects are most likely to convert before you dial
- **Data Quality**: When you [buy MCA leads](/blog/10-questions-when-buying-mca-leads), verify you're getting compliant, accurate data with recent timestamps
- **Compliance**: Always follow [TCPA compliance](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-robocalls-and-texts) guidelines and check the [National Do Not Call Registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/) to protect your business

Small businesses seek funding for legitimate growth opportunities, and resources like the [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/) provide context for their financing journey. Understanding this landscape helps you position merchant cash advance as a strategic tool rather than a last resort.

## Advanced Script Techniques for Higher Close Rates

Beyond the basics, top-performing MCA brokers use these advanced techniques:

### The Pattern Interrupt
When a prospect gives a scripted objection, use unexpected questions:
- "That's interesting—why do you say that?"
- "Help me understand what you mean by that."

These simple questions force prospects out of auto-pilot mode and into genuine conversation.

### The Comparison Close
"[Name], you mentioned you've looked at other funding options. Let me ask you this: if I can get you approved for more money, faster, with less paperwork than what you've seen—would that at least be worth comparing?"

### The Takeaway Close
"You know what, [Name], I'm not sure this is the right fit for you. Most businesses we work with need capital within 48-72 hours and are comfortable with daily payments. It doesn't sound like that's your situation. Am I wrong?"

This reverse psychology often triggers prospects to convince YOU they're qualified, shifting the power dynamic.

## Building a Script Library That Scales

Effective merchant cash advance sales requires more than memorizing one script—you need variations for:

- Different lead sources (web, referral, aged data)
- Different industries (restaurants, retail, service businesses)
- Different funding amounts ($10k vs. $100k)
- Different objection combinations

Document what works, test variations, and continuously refine. Record your calls (with consent) and analyze which phrases generate the best responses.

## Conclusion: Scripts Are Tools, Not Crutches

The best MCA broker scripts serve as frameworks, not word-for-word mandates. Use them as foundations, then adapt to each conversation's unique flow. The brokers who close the most deals are those who internalize these principles until they become second nature.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the average close rate for MCA brokers?
Industry averages range from 5-15% for cold leads, while warm leads can convert at 20-30%. Top performers using optimized MCA sales scripts and high-quality data regularly achieve 25%+ close rates by focusing on pre-qualified prospects and mastering objection handling.

### How long should an MCA sales call last?
Effective closing calls typically last 8-15 minutes. Longer calls often indicate poor qualification or excessive objection handling. Use time-efficient scripts that qualify quickly, address 1-2 major objections, and move to close. Drawn-out calls reduce your daily dial capacity without improving conversion.

### Can I legally cold call businesses for MCA leads?
Yes, B2B cold calling is legal, but you must comply with TCPA regulations, respect Do Not Call lists, and follow state-specific telemarketing laws. Always verify your lead source provides compliant, business-verified data. Calling cell phones requires prior express written consent unless you have an established business relationship.

### What's the best time to call MCA prospects?
Data shows highest contact rates occur Tuesday-Thursday between 10 AM-12 PM and 2 PM-4 PM in the prospect's local timezone. Avoid Mondays (busy catching up) and Fridays (mentally checked out). For restaurant and retail leads, call during slow periods, typically mid-afternoon between lunch and dinner rushes.

### How do I handle multiple objections in one call?
Address objections in priority order: first handle trust/credibility concerns, then tactical issues (timing, amount), and finally price objections. Use the "feel, felt, found" technique: "I understand how you feel. Other clients felt the same way. Here's what they found..." This validates their concern while providing social proof of resolution.
