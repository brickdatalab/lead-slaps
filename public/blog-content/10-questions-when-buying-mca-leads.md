This guide provides the **10 essential questions** you must ask every potential lead provider before you sign a contract. By focusing on these questions, you can ensure you are investing in leads that are validated, compliant, and ready to convert.

## Section 1: Lead Quality and Sourcing – Understanding the Product

The quality of a lead is determined by how it was generated and how recently the prospect expressed interest. Don't just ask for a price; ask for the story behind the data.

### Question 1: How are the leads generated, and what is the original source?

**Why it matters:** The source determines the prospect's intent. Leads generated from an inbound channel (e.g., a business owner filling out a funding request form) are far more valuable than those scraped from public records (UCC filings) or cold-called lists. Ask for details on their marketing methods—is it paid search, social media, or proprietary data collection? A transparent answer indicates a legitimate operation.

### Question 2: What is the specific qualification criteria for these leads?

**Why it matters:** A qualified lead is one that meets your minimum funding requirements. Standard MCA qualification criteria include minimum monthly revenue, time in business, and a specific funding need. Ensure the provider can filter for your non-negotiables. For example, if you only fund businesses with over $10,000 in monthly revenue and 6+ months in business, the leads must be pre-qualified to that standard.

### Question 3: What is your policy on exclusivity (Shared vs. Exclusive)?

**Why it matters:** **Exclusive MCA leads** are delivered only to your team, eliminating competition and dramatically increasing your conversion rate. Shared leads, while cheaper, are sold to multiple brokers, turning your sales process into a race to the bottom. If you are buying shared leads, ask *how many* other brokers they are shared with. Always prioritize exclusive leads for the highest ROI.

### Question 4: How fresh are the leads, and what is your delivery speed?

**Why it matters:** Timing is everything. A "real-time" lead should be delivered to your CRM within minutes of the business owner submitting their information. Even a few hours can significantly reduce the prospect's interest. Ask for the average age of the leads in the batch you are considering. This is especially important when comparing **live transfer leads** (immediate) with **aged leads** (months old).

## Section 2: Compliance, Data Integrity, and Vetting

Compliance is non-negotiable. A single non-compliant call can result in massive fines under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Data integrity ensures your team isn't wasting time on bad numbers or duplicates.

### Question 5: How do you ensure TCPA and DNC compliance?

**Why it matters:** Your provider must have a clear, documented process for scrubbing leads against the National Do Not Call (DNC) Registry and maintaining clear consent records (opt-in timestamps and IP addresses). If they cannot explain their compliance process in detail, walk away. This protects your business from legal risk.

### Question 6: What is your data verification and deduplication process?

**Why it matters:** You should never pay for bad data or leads you already have. Ask if the provider uses real-time verification tools to check phone numbers and email addresses. More importantly, ask about their deduplication process to ensure the leads are not recycled or sold to you multiple times. The best providers will offer a guarantee against duplicates.

### Question 7: Can you provide a small, verifiable sample of your leads?

**Why it matters:** The proof is in the pudding. A reputable provider should be confident enough in their data quality to offer a small test batch. This allows you to run a quick audit, check the contact rates, and verify the information before committing to a large purchase. Use this sample to check for accuracy and intent.

## Section 3: Pricing, Volume, and Support

Lead buying is a partnership. You need to understand the financial commitment, the provider's capacity, and the support they offer when things go wrong.

### Question 8: What is the pricing structure, and are there volume discounts?

**Why it matters:** MCA leads are typically priced per lead, but the cost varies significantly based on type (aged, shared, exclusive, live transfer). Understand the cost per lead (CPL) and how it scales. For example, **aged leads** are significantly cheaper than real-time leads. Ask about volume commitments and whether the price includes all data points or if there are hidden fees for additional information.

### Question 9: What is your lead replacement or refund policy for bad data?

**Why it matters:** Even the best providers will occasionally deliver a bad lead (e.g., disconnected number, wrong industry, or a duplicate). A fair replacement policy is a sign of a trustworthy partner. Ask for their specific criteria for a replacement: Is it a disconnected number? A business that has closed? A duplicate? A clear, written policy protects your investment.

### Question 10: What is your maximum daily/weekly volume capacity?

**Why it matters:** Your sales team needs a consistent, predictable flow of leads to hit their targets. If a provider can only deliver 50 leads per week, but your team can handle 200, you have a bottleneck. Conversely, if they promise 500 but only deliver 50, your team will be idle. Ensure their capacity aligns with your operational needs and that they can sustain the volume over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: What is the difference between "Aged Leads" and "Real-Time Leads"?

**Aged leads** are leads that were generated weeks or months ago and have been sold multiple times. They are the cheapest option but have the lowest conversion rate. **Real-time leads** are delivered to you immediately after the prospect submits their information, offering the highest conversion potential because the prospect's intent is fresh.

### Q2: Why are Live Transfer Leads the most expensive?

**Live transfer leads** are the most expensive because they represent the highest level of qualification and intent. The lead provider's call center has already spoken to the business owner, confirmed their interest in an MCA, and immediately transferred the call to your sales agent. This bypasses the initial cold-calling and qualification steps, leading to significantly higher close rates.

### Q3: What is a UCC Lead, and are they compliant?

A UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) lead is a business that has filed a UCC-1 statement, typically indicating they have secured financing in the past. These are public records and are often used to create large lists of potential borrowers. While they are a source of data, they are generally considered "cold" leads as the business owner has not recently expressed interest in new funding. Their compliance depends on how they are used—cold calling them still requires DNC compliance checks.

### Q4: How many times should I follow up on a new MCA lead?

The financial services industry often requires a persistent follow-up strategy. Experts recommend a minimum of 7-10 contact attempts (calls, emails, texts) over a two-week period for a fresh lead. The first contact should be made within 5 minutes of receiving the lead.

### Q5: What is the typical conversion rate for MCA leads?

Conversion rates vary widely based on the lead type:
*   **Aged/UCC Leads:** 0.5% - 2%
*   **Shared Real-Time Leads:** 2% - 5%
*   **Exclusive Real-Time Leads:** 5% - 10%
*   **Live Transfer Leads:** 10% - 20%
These are general estimates; your team's sales skill and follow-up process are the biggest factors.
