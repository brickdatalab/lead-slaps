# Blog Content Expansion - 4 SEO-Optimized Articles

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use 4 parallel Task agents to write articles concurrently, then a final agent to integrate them into the site.

**Goal:** Create 4 hyper-SEO-focused blog articles that drive organic traffic and funnel visitors to Lead Slaps products/services.

**Architecture:** Each article targets a unique high-intent keyword cluster, includes strategic internal links to site pages (/products, /add-ons, /build-data-set, /contact, other blog posts), external authority links, and follows the existing markdown format in `public/blog-content/`.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown articles, React Blog.tsx integration, existing image assets
